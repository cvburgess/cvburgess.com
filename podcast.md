# Practically Useless

Start your day with a quick and easy listen that mixes practical life advice and some fun, trivial (and totally useless) facts!

Conversations include life hacks for higher productivity, deeper relationships, optimal health, mindful living, and powerful tools and technologies. Hosted with love, sass, and plenty of laughs by Yoga teacher, improv comedian, and engineer Charles Burgess.
