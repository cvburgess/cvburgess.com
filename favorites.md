# My Favorite Things

I may not be Oprah (a boy can dream), but I have tried _a lot of products and services_ over the years and kept what worked for me.

Save yourself the hassle (and cost) of figuring out which products, apps, and services will make your life a little easier and lean on my favorite things below.

This page uses referral links and codes where possible.
This usually means you get a discount and I get a (laughably) small kickback.
It helps support my work and hopefully saves you money, too!

None of these products or services have been chosen for their referral value and are things I truly think you'll enjoy - if you'd rather go to their site directly, be my guest!

# 1. 1Password

Like I discussed on [the podcast](/podcast), **you need a password manager** - full stop.

I don't care if you are an investment banker or a hobbyist baker, it's going to make your life easier, faster, and more secure overnight.

In fact, some companies (like the cybersecurity startup I worked for) require the use of a password manager now, and **failure to do so can result in immediate termination** - no questions asked. YIKES!

[1Password](https://1password.com/) is the best of the best. It's easy to use, works on every device you own (even smart watches) and with a business or family plan you can even securely share passwords with the people that need them. No more copy-pasting that Netflix password to your parents!

My favorite thing about 1Password is that if your company pays for a work plan, you get a family plan for every employee for free!

# 2. Freeletics

For over four years now, [Freeletics](https://www.freeletics.com/r/103284638) has been a staple in my movement routine. I love that as I've grown an changed, so has the app and the exercises it has given me.

A little backstory: **I hate gyms**. I don't feel comfortable in them, I don't like weights and machines, and I don't like that everyone looks at me when I take dance breaks inm the middle of the floor. Rude.

That being said, I still want to look and feel like a vegan beefcake and my Yoga practice doesn't get me there.

Enter [Freeletics](https://www.freeletics.com/r/103284638), which mixes Yoga, bodyweight HIIT training, and even running and weights (if you want that) into a customized-for-you workout experience. You tell it what your goals are, what equipment you own (if any) and what kind of movements you enjoy.

Through their **AI personal trainer named "Coach"**, you can alter any workout based on your time, space, and how you're feeling and it will even curate a training journey and weekly workouts for you.

I personally gained 25lbs of muscle in a few months and [Freeletics](https://www.freeletics.com/r/103284638) was a huge part of that. I've watched friends lose weight, feel better, and achieve their personal fitness goals with Freeletics.

At less than $7 a month, it's cheaper than any gym membership and you can workout from your own home, yard, or wherever gets you excited.

If you want some handy tools to use with the app, I recommend a [pull up bar](https://amzn.to/39SlCsb), [resistance bands](https://amzn.to/3qFS9Z0), and a [foam roller](https://amzn.to/3p0iPU0).

# 10. Who Gives a Crap

While I had a lot to worry about in 2020, I was grateful toilet paper was not one of them.

[Who Gives A Crap](https://www.talkable.com/x/JEscVT) was a company I decided to give a go long before toilet paper was a hot commodity. One of my big goals in 2020 was to reduce my plastic consumption and WGAC ships you 48, 100% recycled paper or bamboo (fancy!) rolls in plastic-free packaging.

The toilet paper is soft, the packaging is adorable if you get recycled and classy if you upgrade to bamboo, and they even offer auto-ship with discounts if you go through it quickly as well as **a 100% money-back guarantee**. Honestly, my one box has lasted me all year and its still going!

They also offer paper towels and tissues and 50% of all profits are donated to help build toilets around the world for those that need them through various charitable partnerships.
