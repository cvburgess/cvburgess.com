# My Favorite Things

I may not be Oprah (a boy can dream), but I have tried _a lot of products and services_ over the years and kept what worked for me.

Save yourself the hassle (and cost) of figuring out which products, apps, and services will make your life a little easier and lean on my favorite things below.

This page uses referral links and codes where possible.
This usually means you get a discount and I get a (laughably) small kickback.
It helps support my work and hopefully saves you money, too!

None of these products or services have been chosen for their referral value and are things I truly think you'll enjoy - if you'd rather go to their site directly, be my guest!

# 1. 1Password

Like I discussed on [the podcast](/podcast), **you need a password manager** - full stop.

I don't care if you are an investment banker or a hobbyist baker, it's going to make your life easier, faster, and more secure overnight.

In fact, some companies (like the cybersecurity startup I worked for) require the use of a password manager now, and **failure to do so can result in immediate termination** - no questions asked. YIKES!

[1Password](https://1password.com/) is the best of the best. It's easy to use, works on every device you own (even smart watches) and with a business or family plan you can even securely share passwords with the people that need them. No more copy-pasting that Netflix password to your parents!

My favorite thing about 1Password is that if your company pays for a work plan, you get a family plan for every employee for free!

# 2. Freeletics

For over four years now, [Freeletics](https://www.freeletics.com/r/103284638) has been a staple in my movement routine. I love that as I've grown an changed, so has the app and the exercises it has given me.

A little backstory: **I hate gyms**. I don't feel comfortable in them, I don't like weights and machines, and I don't like that everyone looks at me when I take dance breaks inm the middle of the floor. Rude.

That being said, I still want to look and feel like a vegan beefcake and my Yoga practice doesn't get me there.

Enter [Freeletics](https://www.freeletics.com/r/103284638), which mixes Yoga, bodyweight HIIT training, and even running and weights (if you want that) into a customized-for-you workout experience. You tell it what your goals are, what equipment you own (if any) and what kind of movements you enjoy.

Through their **AI personal trainer named "Coach"**, you can alter any workout based on your time, space, and how you're feeling and it will even curate a training journey and weekly workouts for you.

I personally gained 25lbs of muscle in a few months and [Freeletics](https://www.freeletics.com/r/103284638) was a huge part of that. I've watched friends lose weight, feel better, and achieve their personal fitness goals with Freeletics.

At less than $7 a month, it's cheaper than any gym membership and you can workout from your own home, yard, or wherever gets you excited.

If you want some handy tools to use with the app, I recommend a [pull up bar](https://amzn.to/39SlCsb), [resistance bands](https://amzn.to/3qFS9Z0), and a [foam roller](https://amzn.to/3p0iPU0).

# 6. GoGoGo

This game really is obnoxiously fun for all ages.
With options for kids or not, paper and pen or phones, and 3+ players you can easily make this game a crowd pleaser for any group.
Each turn one player will sit out and play referee, the others will compete in a fun mini-game of the referees choosing given the options on the phone or tablet. Once a winner is chosen, the referee passes the device to the next player and you repeat until one player has enough wins under their belt to be crowned.

Mini-games include pressing a button blindfolded, 60s paper airplane wars, and "find the duck" among dozens more.
Each mini-game usually takes less than 5 minutes and you can easily put the device down between rounds as food is ready or the conversation picks up. Its a wonderful icebreaker and a fun way to connect with friends and family when you don't want to commit to a full-on board game or you need a break from Cards Against Humanity and Jackbox.

The game is free and you can purchase a pack of 50 additional mini-games in the app for $2.99 or so.

# 8. Eero Mesh Wifi

If you work from home or enjoy lots of FaceTime with your friends and family, you need good internet. If you value your sanity, you need your own router that you can install and manage from your phone and spreads wifi over your whole apartment, home, and yes, even the yard.

Eero is an Amazon-owned mesh system, which is a fancy way of saying you can add as many of these to your house as you want and they will all pretend to be one router. Add one anywhere you wish you had better internet the app does the rest in minutes.

The app also offers easy access to parental controls, security features, and automatic updates for your system.

If you want simple, solid wifi everywhere you can get it, you need an Eero.

# 10. Who Gives a Crap

While I had a lot to worry about in 2020, I was grateful toilet paper was not one of them.

[Who Gives A Crap](https://www.talkable.com/x/JEscVT) was a company I decided to give a go long before toilet paper was a hot commodity. One of my big goals in 2020 was to reduce my plastic consumption and WGAC ships you 48, 100% recycled paper or bamboo (fancy!) rolls in plastic-free packaging.

The toilet paper is soft, the packaging is adorable if you get recycled and classy if you upgrade to bamboo, and they even offer auto-ship with discounts if you go through it quickly as well as **a 100% money-back guarantee**. Honestly, my one box has lasted me all year and its still going!

They also offer paper towels and tissues and 50% of all profits are donated to help build toilets around the world for those that need them through various charitable partnerships.
