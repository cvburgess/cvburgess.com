# Live Classes

I teach weekly classes here in sunny Tampa, Florida that are open to anyone at any level that will have you moving and laughing and dancing in no time.

Class starts every Thursday at 6 PM and does sell out from time to time, so book online or call ahead to save your spot!

If you want something just for you ( and maybe your friends, family, or coworkers ) I offer fun, inspired classes customized to your unique audience both on-location and online.

[Get in touch](mailto:yoga@cvburgess.com) to plan something today!
