<h1 class="title">Lead with Joy</h1>
<p class="subtitle">Tools and insights to help engineering leaders change how we work, together.</p>
<p>
  There isn't a clear point in time where we can declare we are "officially a grown up", and the same is true for leadership.
  <br/>
  No title or tenure makes you a leader.
  <em>You're a leader when people start to lean on you</em> - ready or not.
  <br/>
  This project is for those in (or aspiring to be in) that position as they learn to lead in an authentic, sustainable way.
