<h1 class="title">Who's This Guy?</h1>
<p class="subtitle">Apparently I do have to write a bio eventually.</p>

<div class="bio full-width center-responsive">
  <p class="margin-large-horizontal">
    Engineer, comedian, yoga teacher, and serial hobbyist.<br/>
    I love developing teams and mentoring leaders as they navigate an industry that rarely stops to breathe... or laugh.
    <br/>Other faves include dogs, puns, and RPGs.
