    "transcript": `Maybe you love your job, maybe you don't. But either way, chances are really good you're going to have another one and another one and another one. There's one thing that you're going to have to do almost every single time and that's updating your resume. For most people, that's about as fun and exciting as going to the dentist. No shade to my dentist friends. Love you all. I see people struggle with three main issues when they're editing the resume. They're trying to stand out in a good way and they don't know how. They're trying to really pump themselves up without sounding like they're bragging and definitely without underselling themselves. You've got to do all of that in one to maybe two pages, which is a pretty tall order.

But my number one tip for editing your resume really checks all of these boxes. I'm recommending you take that paragraph at the top of your resume, the objective (if you have one), and kill it. It's cheesy. It's always the same for pretty much everybody. It's, I want to work with your company because, or, I'm a good fit because I read the job description and paraphrased it lightly. It doesn't make you stand out as much as maybe if you have a personal narrative a cover letter would. It's really pretty much identical from candidate to candidate. As somebody reading it, I almost always skip over it. I don't mean to, but I've usually got a pretty thick stack of resumes and it's never once really been a differentiator for a candidate.

So instead, knowing that somebody is going to look at your resume, and this is the first thing they're going to see. If you take that, you reclaim your space, I recommend you add five bullet points to the top. You can call it whatever you want. I tend to call it highlights. These are five data-driven bullet points that are going to sum up your resume and make it so Buzzfeed-style clickbait, need-to-read that anybody looking at your resume is going to finish the whole darn thing and they're going to remember you right from the get-go.

Were you ever looking for that article about the five things you didn't know about ice cream? Probably not, but you read it and we want the same thing to happen with your resume because you may be the only person that applied for that job... but you could also be one of 100 people and you want to stand out and make an impact right at the beginning. Anybody can do this, and I mean anybody. All you need is a pen, a paper, maybe 30 minutes to an hour of your time to sit down and go over your personal and professional history. Not talking about going through all your bad breakups and all your moves. I'm talking about school, education, opportunities, volunteer work, all of these things. Sum them up, find the highlights, find the things that you're really proud of.

Then we're also going to take those mundane things that maybe you're less proud and we're going to make them awesome. Now, when you take any mundane daily task that involves some level of skill and you add up all the hours or all the people that you did that for, it starts to become something that you're really proud of. So I'll give you some examples. I had a friend that worked in a call center and that may not be the sexiest job ever, but once you add up all the hours you spent on the phone offering technical support, and you can say, "Offered over 4,000 hours of detailed technical customer support," that is now sexy.

If you're a cashier or you're in hospitality, you can take the number of customers that came through your lane or sat at your tables, multiply that by the number shifts that you've had and ballpark it. Maybe being a waitress for two years isn't something that you're super thrilled about. But once you can say you've served 10,000 customers with a high level of quality, that might prepare you for that next sales job. If you're in sales or marketing, talk about your revenue that you generated, talk about the leads that you've captured, talk about all of these efforts because they add up. If you're in yoga and wellness, you've got a resume too. So talk about the hours that you spent hands-on with people, the amount of workshops that you've led, the number of hours you've poured into your certifications and continuing education.

If you're in software tech or some other job, talk about the users that you've reached, the revenue that you've helped directly or indirectly generate through your tools and your apps. Talk about the uptime or the data that you stored in these different databases and tools. Once you add these things up, they get really impressive really fast. I might have five people that have built an app, but there's a huge difference between an app that never hit the App Store and an app that reached millions of people around the world. If you have that story hidden down at the bottom of your resume, and I don't know to look for it, I might miss it altogether. So sell it right at the top.

The act of writing your highlights has another huge benefit that has nothing to do with the person that is reading it and has nothing to do with the company that might turn it into a full-time position. It has everything to do with the fact that writing down all of your accomplishments, summing up all of these things and just soaking that in for a minute will dramatically boost your confidence. The most important thing in a job hunt is taking yourself, loving yourself and really believing in yourself so much that you can sell that to any one and any company.

Because if you don't love yourself - if you don't think you're the most qualified person for this position - it is going to be really hard to sell that to somebody and you can't blame them. But if you believe that every little job you worked up this point, every job you loved or hated, every volunteer opportunity that you've had has added up to and built you into the person that is ready for this next step, then you're going to crush it and everybody is going to want you on their team.

So let's recap. The objective on your resume is a waste of space, a waste of time and a waste of energy for both of you writing it and the person reading it. So if we scrap that and replace it with highlights, highlights are the perfect place to hook in a hirer, get them to really believe in you and get them to go Nancy Drew and read the rest of your resume to figure out where those highlights came from. The process of making those highlights is going to transform your confidence so dramatically that it might even change the type of jobs that you're looking for and the bar that you set for yourself.`

    "transcript": `There are some people you hear from all the time. Maybe you have a group text with your family, or your gal pals, maybe you're all over social media and you hear from people left and right. But, there are probably some people you don't hear from as often as you'd like. Old co-workers, childhood friends, family that you only get to see around the holidays. These are the people that I am really interested in bringing back into the fold today. And, what better way to connect with old friends and family, than good old-fashioned snail mail. I know that my inbox is overflowing, at least digitally, and my DMs can get pretty backlogged sometimes. But, my actual mailbox at the front of my house is a source of joy, where when I see a letter from a friend, or a postcard, or a Christmas card, I light up. There's something so fun about unwrapping something that you know was written with love.

Circling back to 2020 January, I had big plans. I was going to detach from social media, really embrace the world, go travel, see friends. And I figured, not my whole family and friends are on group texts that I have. I can't just send a photo and catch up with these people. So, I thought an old-school postcard might be a fun way to reconnect with people that I haven't talked to in a while. Problem being, 2020 didn't go as I planned. So, after sending my January postcard from Washington, DC, and being super happy, getting a lot of responses from childhood friends that I hadn't talked to in years. I realized that maybe these postcards aren't going to work out, how I thought. And, they actually ended up working out way better than I ever imagined.
    
But it wasn't the fun and exciting postcards that got me in touch with people that I love as much as the boring postcards that were honest and real, talking about board games instead of boarding passes, spending time with my Little, from Big Brothers Big Sisters or ripping my kitchen apart with my dad. Just real, regular things, had people reaching out to me and being like, "Hey, I know we haven't talked in a while, but I loved your postcard." "I just remodeled my kitchen too." "Or I didn't know you did Big Brothers Big Sisters, how is that program? I've been interested in that." These are really fun conversations to start and have with people, that were a lot more interesting than, "Sup what's new with you?" These kinds of generic conversation starters that we're so used to don't tend to go very far or very long.
    
If you want to send your own postcards, it's really as simple as these four steps. To have a consistent, awesome postcard practice. Step one, make a list of 10 people maximum that you really want to reach out to. Some of these are given like your mom, your dad, your sister... anybody that would be kind of upset if they didn't get a postcard probably needs to be on the list. Save a couple of slots for the people that you really want to talk to, they're your favorite people in the world that you just don't get to see. Maybe a friend that moved away, a co-worker that switched jobs, or a teacher that you stayed in touch with long after high school or college. Those are the people that you want on the list. But, postcards aren't free. It's not like an email, so make sure that you send only a number that is going to make financial sense to you. We'll get into that later, but expect about $1-3 per person, per postcard.
    
Step two, pick a day, probably the first day of every month or the last day of every month, and review the month that was. Go through your camera roll, your social media posts, your calendar. And, if you have kids or a partner, get them involved. Have everybody contribute what they thought was the highlights and the low lights of the month. You might have even forgotten what happened this month, because there was so much or so little. I know I found myself looking at photos and being like, "Wait, that was this month?" "Okay." It's a great chance for your family to connect. Or if you're like me and you live alone, it's an awesome opportunity to reflect and build gratitude for all the adventures that were.
    
Step three is where the magic really happens. Take those photos, take those moments, and pull them into an app like PostSnap, Ink, Postagram, Felt, Snapfish, whatever floats your boat and start making your postcard. Now, I recommend a postcard as opposed to an old-school letter, because the apps will do the postage for you and they'll print it for you, too. You just have to put this info in and hit send, like it's an Instagram post or a Facebook post, and the rest is done for you. But you can always type up a letter, print it out, go to CVS or Walgreens, print out your photos and send it old school. There's something beautiful and magical about that. By using one of these apps for about $1-3 a postcard, they'll do everything for you. It might be a little bit more pricey if you get a bigger postcard or a fancier postcard. And obviously, postage for Florida is different than France. But, if most of your friends and family live within the United States or your country of choice, it should be pretty straightforward. Also, if you want to save a little extra money, consider buying credits in an app that you use.
    
Send yourself a postcard, see if you like the quality and then commit to buying credits. The easy way to figure this out is take the number of people in your list, multiply it by the number of postcards you plan on sending this year, and buy enough credits to send all of those. One, it'll hold you to your commitment a little better, and two, you can save upwards of 25 or 50%, if you buy these credits in advance, which can make a $2 postcard, a $1 postcard. Or better, a $1 postcard can sometimes even come down to a 50 cent postcard. And, that's the price of a stamp. Last but not least, bonus step four, send a copy to yourself. Now, I know this seems kind of silly. Why would you send yourself a postcard? But, I've held on to all of my 2020 postcards and I have them in my filing cabinet.
    
And, it has been really fun to go back and look through them with my Little, because he is in a couple of those. And, I'm sure five years from now, 10 years from now, it'll be even more fun to go back and look at all the months that were and all the different years. It's like keeping a journal, but a photo journal, and rather than 365 entries a year, there's only 12, which for the lazy man inside of me is really, really convenient.
    
So let's recap. snail mail is a great way to reach out to loved ones and make your own little time capsule. Make a list of maximum 10 people, this can include family, friends, anyone that you don't see very often that isn't following your social media, isn't getting these stories. Then pick one day every month to reflect with your family or by yourself, and figure out what your favorite moments were from that month. Go through your photos, your calendar, and use all of that information to make a postcard on your phone and send it out to everyone on your list. No postage needed, no printer needed, just fun.`

    "title": "Sage Your Social Media",
    "description": `Social media can be one of the best ways to connect with friends, brands, and inspiring people from around the world, but it can also leave you feeling drained, frustrated, and insecure.
In this episode, I share how you can sage your social media and stay sane while scrolling.`,

    "transcript": `Maybe you love social media. Maybe you hate it. Maybe you find yourself on there a lot longer than you wish you were. I know for me, it's a vital part of my business and how I connect with you guys. As much as I don't love social media and I don't love endlessly scrolling, in fact, I've deleted my Facebook at least three times, like completely 100% gone, bye Felicia, deleted not just the app, everything. I've also uninstalled Instagram a few times, but I always find myself coming back usually to connect with really important people or to promote my business.

But that doesn't mean I want to spend all day on my phone. In fact, sometimes when I'm scrolling around and maybe you feel this way too, some weird feelings come up. Some posts can make me feel a little insecure or frustrated. I know with Facebook, I constantly felt like they were promoting the most irritating content right to the top of my feed. In an election year or any other year for that matter, it can feel really overwhelming to be on social media.

So how do we combat that and make it better? Because it doesn't have to be that way, right? It doesn't have to be all or nothing. You're either on social media and you're mindlessly scrolling and feeling like garbage, or you delete it and you live blissfully happily ever after. That's not really how life works. So I have tried several different things. I'm Marie Kondo'ed the crap out of my social feed and I wanted to share that with you guys, because a lot of things I've seen online just didn't stick. I've tried the timer on my iPhone to prevent myself from spending too much time in the app, but even a little bit of time with content that doesn't make you feel 100% awesome is enough time to make you leave not feeling awesome.

So what I'm proposing today is to simply pick one day every month or every couple months and mindfully scroll through your feed. Now, we're not looking for recipe tips here. We're not looking for a new yoga pose. We're not looking for that cute boy, even though he real cute and he knows it. What we're looking for is how each post makes you feel. I've got a quick three-step test here. Before you even open your phone, meditate for a second, sit up nice and tall, close your eyes and ask yourself in one or two words, how do you want to feel after you've used Instagram or after you've used TikTok or after you've used Facebook for 20, 30 minutes. Do you want to feel inspired, informed, hungry, happy, jealous, giggly, annoyed, aroused?

All of these are valid and none are better than the other. But once you know what you want to feel, we can open the phone. We can open a given app and we can start scrolling. For each post, I want you to pause on it for a second, take a deep breath and then answer these three questions. One, how does this post make you feel? Is it aligned with the word that you picked a minute ago? If it is, awesome. Scroll on to the next post. If not, let's ask question number two. Do you love this feeling? Not do you like this feeling? Not is this a good feeling? Do you love this feeling? There's tons of cute things on the internet. There's tons of handsome manses is and handsome womenses, and lots of great recipes, but if that's not what you love and that's not why you came here, move on to question number three.

If you do love it, if it brings you joy, if Marie Kondo would tell you to keep it in your closet, keep scrolling. If you're on question number three, what I want you to ask yourself is, is this reflective of the person who's posting it? Is this what they always post? If the answer to that is yes, this is very indicative of the kind of content they usually post, then maybe it's time to let that go. If it's not, it's okay. People have days where they post things aren't totally congruent with what they usually post. I'm not telling you that there's a zero strike policy, one bad post and you're off my feed. That's silly.

But if this is common to how they post and it's not bringing you joy, it's not bringing you love, it's not bringing you the feels that you want to to have, you need to let it go. Pro tip for people on Instagram, probably the most common network I use, you don't have to completely unfollow somebody. You could silence their posts. It's an option under the dot, dot, dot or the meatball menu if you're technical and you can still follow them, especially if it's like a private meme account. I'm not above a good meme, but you don't have to have that inundated in your feed. So silence that, it will remove it from your feed without unfollowing that person.

But if you really just don't want it and it doesn't add anything to you, you're not going to miss it, unfollow. Say bye Felicia, click that button, and then you've made room for only the best content. This is a really good feeling. I've got my social media really cleaned up. I have a friend who takes us to a different extreme. She's a yoga teacher and she on Facebook because you can't like Instagram follow and unfollow. You're either friends or you're not. Well, Facebook added the ability for you to hide or unfollow a person who you're friends with. So she actually will friend somebody and then immediately unfollow them, and there's no content in her feed is not another yoga teacher promoting their classes.

That is so beneficial because she decided that the only reason she was on Instagram and only reason she's on Facebook is to promote her yoga classes. She doesn't need anything else and so she's being honest to that commitment as much as she'd love to see friends and family, cleared it out. It makes it a really easy decision. Are you promoting yoga classes? If yes, I get to see it and I can help you promote or attend your class. If not, bye. You're still friends on Facebook, nobody's feelings are hurt, but it's not taking time and energy away from you and it doesn't give you that temptation. I'm not that extreme. I love a good vegan macaroni and cheese recipe. If you're going to slide up in my feed, I'm going to make it. But that is an extreme version you could try.

But now if you've cleaned up all of this stuff, you have the ability to pick and choose what content you want in your feed now. What I love to do I'm done saging my social media, clearing it out, riding it of all that bad energy, I go to my friends who I love, my sisters and I ask them, "Hey, what accounts inspire you?" Or if you have a different word for you, maybe you want things that make you laugh, what are the funniest accounts you follow? Whatever your word is, ask people that you really resonate with what they follow and what brings joy to their feed and see if you now have room to add that to your feed. If you don't love it, next month you just clear it out, real simple.

So to recap. To sage your social media is pretty darn simple. First, you need to figure out how you want to feel when you use a given app. They don't all have to be the same. You could go to TikTok for laughs and you could go for Instagram to be inspired, but you need to know how you want to feel. Then pick a day and consciously scroll through your feed and ask yourself if each post matches up with that intention. If it doesn't, ask yourself if that poster matches up with that intention. If not, time to let it go. Once you cleaned out all the things that don't serve you anymore, you've got room. Your closet's empty, time to go shopping. If you want, you can ask your friends for content that matches how you want to feel. Try some new accounts, get some fresh energy into your feed and try again in 30 days, see if that still matches with your intention.`
